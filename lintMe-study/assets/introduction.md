# Introduction

Welcome to the LintMe Usability Study!

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of **LintMe**, a customizable markdown linting tool designed to improve the quality and clarity of README files. README files are critical components of open-source and collaborative software projects, serving as the primary documentation users encounter.

During this study, you will:

1. Begin with a brief tutorial to get familiar with LintMeâ€™s features and interface.
2. Apply predefined and/or custom linting rules using LintMe to evaluate or improve your own README file(s).
3. Complete a survey sharing your experience with the tool and its impact on your documentation practices.

After you successfully complete the study, your responses and the rules you applied will help us understand how customizable linting tools influence documentation quality and user experience. You will receive compensation for your time, and we sincerely appreciate your participation and contribution. Thank you for taking part!
