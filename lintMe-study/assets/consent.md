# Consent

Before we begin, please read the following consent form carefully and thereafter complete the section below.

**Goal:** To evaluate the usability and effectiveness of **LintMe**, a customizable markdown linting tool designed to improve the quality and clarity of README files. 

**Procedure:** You will begin by completing a brief tutorial on how to use the LintMe tool. You will then apply existing linting rules, modify them, and/or create new rules to improve your own markdown documentation (e.g., a README file). After completing the documentation task, you will be asked to fill out a short post-task survey and submit all the linting rules you applied.

**Duration:** The estimated completion time for the experiment is 1 hour and 30 minutes.

**Privacy:** Your participation is anonymous and your responses cannot be used to identify you.

**Record Keeping:** Records of your participation will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, 
the study investigators and, under certain circumstances, the Institutional Review Board will be able to inspect and 
have access to this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you.

**Reward:** $40.
